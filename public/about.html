<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Muhammad Ajmal Dan Aliyu. I am a Tech enthusiast and a believer in God. 
  I am a student of Angela Yu of the App Brewery Academy in the United Kingdom. I love Python programming 
  and I look forward to building notable web applications using the DJANGO Framework.  .</p>

<p>One verse of the Holy Bible that i really love is "With God ALL things are possible". So, since i 
  believe i have God, then nothing should be impossible for me when i put my mind to it and consistently
  give it what it takes.
</p>

<p>I look forward to working remotely with the big Tech Multinationals and start my own start up on how to 
  handle some solar powered devices for optimal utilisation. I also have it in mind to travel around the world 
  while i make the world a better place. </p>
